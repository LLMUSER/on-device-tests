            "[Document(page_content=\"India, officially the Republic of India (ISO: Bhārat Gaṇarājya),[21] is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area; the most populous country as of June 2023;[22][23] and from the time of its independence in 1947, the world's most populous democracy.[24][25][26] Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west;[j] China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand, Myanmar, and Indonesia. Modern humans arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa no later than 55,000 years ago.[27][28][29] Their long occupation, initially in varying forms of isolation as hunter-gatherers, has made the region highly diverse, second only to Africa in human genetic diversity.[30] Settled life emerged on the subcontinent in the western margins of the Indus river basin 9,000 years ago, evolving gradually into the Indus Valley Civilisation of the third millennium BCE.[31] By 1200 BCE, an archaic form of Sanskrit, an Indo-European language, had diffused into India from the northwest.[32][33] Its evidence today is found in the hymns of the Rigveda. Preserved by an oral tradition that was resolutely vigilant, the Rigveda records the dawning of Hinduism in India.[34] The Dravidian languages of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35] By 400 BCE, stratification and exclusion by caste had emerged within Hinduism,[36] and Buddhism and Jainism had arisen, proclaiming social orders unlinked to heredity.[37] Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit Maurya and Gupta Empires based in the Ganges Basin.[38] Their collective era was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39] but also marked by the declining status of women,[40] and the incorporation of untouchability into an organised system of belief.[k][41] In South India, the Middle kingdoms exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of Southeast Asia.[42] In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism became established on India's southern and western coasts.[43] Muslim armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's northern plains,[44] eventually founding the Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[45] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47] The Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][49] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[50] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52] but technological changes were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[53] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55] In 1947 the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two independent dominions,[56][57][58][59] a Hindu-majority Dominion of India and a Muslim-majority Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60] India has been a federal republic since 1950, governed through a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[61] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62] India has become a fast-growing major economy and a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63] It has a space programme. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[64] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[65] India is a nuclear-weapon state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[66] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[67] and rising levels of air pollution.[68] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[69] Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[70] India's wildlife, \", metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmpio2kawgs', 'page': 0}), Document(page_content='which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India\\'s culture,[71] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats. Etymology According to the Oxford English Dictionary (third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the Classical Latin India, a reference to South Asia and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name \"India\" derived successively from Hellenistic Greek India ( Ἰνδία), ancient Greek Indos ( Ἰνδός), Old Persian Hindush (an eastern province of the Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its cognate, the Sanskrit Sindhu, or \"river\", specifically the Indus River and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73] The ancient Greeks referred to the Indians as Indoi (Ἰνδοί), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[74] The term Bharat (Bhārat; pronounced [ˈbʱaːɾət] (listen)), mentioned in both Indian epic poetry and the Constitution of India,[75][76] is used in its variations by many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to North India,[77][78] Bharat gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79] Hindustan ([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn] (listen)) is a Middle Persian name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[80] and was used widely since the era of Mughal Empire. The meaning of Hindustan has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and Pakistan or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][81] History Main articles: History of India and History of the Republic of India Ancient India illustration, c.\\u20091650, of the Sanskrit epic Ramayana, composed in story-telling fashion c.\\u2009400 BCE – c.\\u2009300 CE[82] By 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29] The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[83] These gradually developed into the Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83] the first urban culture in South Asia,[85] which flourished during 2500–1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[86] Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, Harappa, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85] During the period 2000–500 BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the Chalcolithic cultures to the Iron Age ones.[87] The Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism,[88] were composed during this period,[89] and historians have analysed these to posit a Vedic culture in the Punjab region and the upper Gangetic Plain.[87] Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of Indo-Aryan migration into the subcontinent from the north-west.[88] The caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[90] On the Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[87] In South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of megalithic monuments dating from this period,[91] as well as by nearby traces of agriculture, irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[91] 26 of the rock-cut Ajanta Caves In the late Vedic period, around the 6th century BCE, the small states and chiefdoms of the Ganges Plain and the north-western regions had consolidated into 16 major oligarchies and monarchies that were known as the mahajanapadas.[92][93] The emerging urbanisation gave rise to \\n', metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmpio2kawgs', 'page': 1}), Document(page_content=\"non-Vedic religious movements, two of which became independent religions. Jainism came into prominence during the life of its exemplar, Mahavira.[94] Buddhism, based on the teachings of Gautama Buddha, attracted followers from all social classes excepting the middle class; chronicling the life of the Buddha was central to the beginnings of recorded history in India.[95][96][97] In an age of increasing urban wealth, both religions held up renunciation as an ideal,[98] and both established long-lasting monastic traditions. Politically, by the 3rd century BCE, the kingdom of Magadha had annexed or reduced other states to emerge as the Mauryan Empire.[99] The empire was once thought to have controlled most of the subcontinent except the far south, but its core regions are now thought to have been separated by large autonomous areas.[100][101] The Mauryan kings are known as much for their empire-building and determined management of public life as for Ashoka's renunciation of militarism and far-flung advocacy of the Buddhist dhamma.[102][103] The Sangam literature of the Tamil language reveals that, between 200 BCE and 200 CE, the southern peninsula was ruled by the Cheras, the Cholas, and the Pandyas, dynasties that traded extensively with the Roman Empire and with West and Southeast Asia.[104][105] In North India, Hinduism asserted patriarchal control within the family, leading to increased subordination of women.[106][99] By the 4th and 5th centuries, the Gupta Empire had created a complex system of administration and taxation in the greater Ganges Plain; this system became a model for later Indian kingdoms.[107][108] Under the Guptas, a renewed Hinduism based on devotion, rather than the management of ritual, began to assert itself.[109] This renewal was reflected in a flowering of sculpture and architecture, which found patrons among an urban elite.[108] Classical Sanskrit literature flowered as well, and Indian science, astronomy, medicine, and mathematics made significant advances.[108] Medieval India  The Qutub Minar, 73 m (240 ft) tall, completed by the Sultan of Delhi, Iltutmish The Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200 CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[110] When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the Chalukya ruler of the Deccan.[111] When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the Pala king of Bengal.[111] When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south.[111] No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[110] During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[112] The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[112] In the 6th and 7th centuries, the first devotional hymns were created in the Tamil language.[113] They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all modern languages of the subcontinent.[113] Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[114] Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[114] By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Brunei, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Indonesia.[115] Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[115] After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206.[116] The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject \", metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmpio2kawgs', 'page': 2}), Document(page_content=\"population to its own laws and customs.[117][118] By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[119][120] The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous Vijayanagara Empire.[121] Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[122] and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[121] Early modern India In the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[123] fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124] The resulting Mughal Empire did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[125][126] and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[127] leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[128] Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[127] The Mughal state's economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[129] and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[130] caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[128] The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India's economic expansion,[128] resulting in greater patronage of painting, literary forms, textiles, and architecture.[131] Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the Marathas, the Rajputs, and the Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[132] Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[132] As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[133]   \", metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmpio2kawgs', 'page': 3})]\n",

Preserved by an\\xa0oral tradition\\xa0that was\\xa0resolutely vigilant, the\\xa0Rigveda\\xa0records the dawning of\\xa0Hinduism\\xa0in India.[34]\\xa0The\\xa0Dravidian languages\\xa0of India were supplanted in the northern and western regions.[35]\\xa0By 400\\xa0BCE,\\xa0stratification\\xa0and\\xa0exclusion\\xa0by\\xa0caste\\xa0had emerged within Hinduism,[36]\\xa0and\\xa0Buddhism\\xa0and\\xa0Jainism\\xa0had arisen, proclaiming\\xa0social orders\\xa0unlinked to heredity.[37]\\xa0Early political consolidations gave rise to the loose-knit\\xa0Maurya\\xa0and\\xa0Gupta Empires\\xa0based in the\\xa0Ganges Basin.[38]\\xa0Their collective\\xa0era\\xa0was suffused with wide-ranging creativity,[39]\\xa0but also marked by the declining status of women,[40]\\xa0and the incorporation of\\xa0untouchability\\xa0into an organised system of belief.[k][41]\\xa0In\\xa0South India, the\\xa0Middle kingdoms\\xa0exported Dravidian-languages scripts and religious cultures to the kingdoms of\\xa0Southeast Asia.[42]\\n\\nIn the early medieval era,\\xa0Christianity,\\xa0Islam,\\xa0Judaism, and\\xa0Zoroastrianism\\xa0became established on India\\'s southern and western coasts.[43]\\xa0Muslim armies from\\xa0Central Asia\\xa0intermittently overran India\\'s northern plains,[44]\\xa0eventually founding the\\xa0Delhi Sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan\\xa0networks of medieval Islam.[45]\\xa0In the 15th century, the\\xa0Vijayanagara Empire\\xa0created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[46]\\xa0In the\\xa0Punjab,\\xa0Sikhism\\xa0emerged, rejecting institutionalised religion.[47]\\xa0The\\xa0Mughal Empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[48]\\xa0leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[l][49]\\xa0Gradually expanding\\xa0rule of the British East India Company\\xa0followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its\\xa0sovereignty.[50]\\xa0British Crown rule\\xa0began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[51][52]\\xa0but\\xa0technological changes\\xa0were introduced, and modern ideas of education and the public life took root.[53]\\xa0A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged, which was noted for nonviolent resistance and became the major factor in ending British rule.[54][55]\\xa0In 1947 the British Indian Empire was\\xa0partitioned\\xa0into two independent\\xa0dominions,[56][57][58][59]\\xa0a Hindu-majority\\xa0Dominion of India\\xa0and a Muslim-majority\\xa0Dominion of Pakistan, amid large-scale loss of life and an unprecedented migration.[60]\\n\\nIndia has been a\\xa0federal republic\\xa0since 1950, governed through a democratic\\xa0parliamentary system. It is a\\xa0pluralistic,\\xa0multilingual\\xa0and\\xa0multi-ethnic society. India\\'s population grew from 361 million in 1951 to almost 1.4 billion in 2022.[61]\\xa0During the same time, its nominal\\xa0per capita income\\xa0increased from US$64 annually to US$2,601, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[62]\\xa0India has become a\\xa0fast-growing\\xa0major economy\\xa0and a hub for\\xa0information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[63]\\xa0It has\\xa0a space programme. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[64]\\xa0India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[65]\\xa0India is a\\xa0nuclear-weapon state, which\\xa0ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over\\xa0Kashmir\\xa0with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[66]\\xa0Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are\\xa0gender inequality,\\xa0child malnutrition,[67]\\xa0and rising levels of\\xa0air pollution.[68]\\xa0India\\'s land is\\xa0megadiverse, with four\\xa0biodiversity hotspots.[69]\\xa0Its forest cover comprises 21.7% of its area.[70]\\xa0India\\'s wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in\\xa0India\\'s culture,[71]\\xa0is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in\\xa0protected habitats.\\n\\nEtymology\\n\\nAccording to the\\xa0Oxford English Dictionary\\xa0(third edition 2009), the name \"India\" is derived from the\\xa0Classical Latin\\xa0India, a reference to\\xa0South Asia\\xa0and an uncertain region to its east. In turn the name \"India\" derived successively from\\xa0Hellenistic Greek\\xa0India\\xa0(\\xa0Ἰνδία),\\xa0ancient Greek\\xa0Indos\\xa0(\\xa0Ἰνδός),\\xa0Old Persian\\xa0Hindush\\xa0(an eastern province of the\\xa0Achaemenid Empire), and ultimately its\\xa0cognate, the\\xa0Sanskrit\\xa0Sindhu, or \"river\", specifically the\\xa0Indus River\\xa0and, by implication, its well-settled southern basin.[72][73]\\xa0The\\xa0ancient Greeks\\xa0referred to the Indians as\\xa0Indoi\\xa0(Ἰνδοί), which translates as \"The people of the Indus\".[74]\\n\\nThe term\\xa0Bharat\\xa0(Bhārat;\\xa0pronounced\\xa0[ˈbʱaːɾət]\\xa0(listen)), mentioned in both\\xa0Indian epic poetry\\xa0and the\\xa0Constitution of India,[75][76]\\xa0is used in its variations by\\xa0many Indian languages. A modern rendering of the historical name\\xa0Bharatavarsha, which applied originally to\\xa0North India,[77][78]\\xa0Bharat\\xa0gained increased currency from the mid-19th century as a native name for India.[75][79]\\n\\nHindustan\\xa0([ɦɪndʊˈstaːn]\\xa0(listen)) is a\\xa0Middle Persian\\xa0name for India that became popular by the 13th century,[80]\\xa0and was used widely since the era of\\xa0Mughal Empire. The meaning of\\xa0Hindustan\\xa0has varied, referring to a region encompassing present-day northern India and\\xa0Pakistan\\xa0or to India in its near entirety.[75][79][81]\\n\\nHistory\\n\\nMain articles:\\xa0History of India\\xa0and\\xa0History of the Republic of India\\n\\nBy 55,000 years ago, the first modern humans, or\\xa0Homo sapiens, had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[27][28][29]\\xa0The earliest known modern human remains in South Asia date to about 30,000 years ago.[27]\\xa0After 6500\\xa0BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in\\xa0Mehrgarh\\xa0and other sites in\\xa0Balochistan, Pakistan.[83]\\xa0These gradually developed into the\\xa0Indus Valley Civilisation,[84][83]\\xa0the first urban culture in South Asia,[85]\\xa0which flourished during 2500–1900\\xa0BCE\\xa0in Pakistan and western India.[86]\\xa0Centred around cities such as\\xa0Mohenjo-daro,\\xa0Harappa,\\xa0Dholavira, and\\xa0Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[85]\\n\\nDuring the period 2000–500\\xa0BCE, many regions of the subcontinent transitioned from the\\xa0Chalcolithic\\xa0cultures to the\\xa0Iron Age\\xa0ones.[87]\\xa0The\\xa0Vedas, the oldest scriptures associated with\\xa0Hinduism,[88]\\xa0were composed during this period,[89]\\xa0and historians have analysed these to posit a\\xa0Vedic culture\\xa0in the\\xa0Punjab region\\xa0and the upper\\xa0Gangetic Plain.[87]\\xa0Most historians also consider this period to have encompassed several waves of\\xa0Indo-Aryan migration\\xa0into the subcontinent from the north-west.[88]\\xa0The\\xa0caste system, which created a hierarchy of priests, warriors, and free peasants, but which excluded indigenous peoples by labelling their occupations impure, arose during this period.[90]\\xa0On the\\xa0Deccan Plateau, archaeological evidence from this period suggests the existence of a chiefdom stage of political organisation.[87]\\xa0In\\xa0South India, a progression to sedentary life is indicated by the large number of\\xa0megalithic\\xa0monuments dating from this period,[91]\\xa0as well as by nearby traces of\\xa0agriculture,\\xa0irrigation tanks, and craft traditions.[91]\\n\\nThe\\xa0Qutub Minar, 73\\xa0m (240\\xa0ft) tall, completed by the\\xa0Sultan of Delhi,\\xa0Iltutmish\\n\\nThe Indian early medieval age, from 600 to 1200\\xa0CE, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity.[110]\\xa0When\\xa0Harsha\\xa0of\\xa0Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647\\xa0CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the\\xa0Chalukya\\xa0ruler of the Deccan.[111]\\xa0When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the\\xa0Pala\\xa0king of\\xa0Bengal.[111]\\xa0When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the\\xa0Pallavas\\xa0from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the\\xa0Pandyas\\xa0and the\\xa0Cholas\\xa0from still farther south.[111]\\xa0No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond their core region.[110]\\xa0During this time, pastoral peoples, whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy, were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.[112]\\xa0The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.[112]\\n\\nIn the 6th and 7th centuries, the first\\xa0devotional hymns\\xa0were created in the Tamil language.[113]\\xa0They were imitated all over India and led to both the resurgence of Hinduism and the development of all\\xa0modern languages of the subcontinent.[113]\\xa0Indian royalty, big and small, and the temples they patronised drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well.[114]\\xa0Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation.[114]\\xa0By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day\\xa0Myanmar,\\xa0Thailand,\\xa0Laos,\\xa0Brunei,\\xa0Cambodia,\\xa0Vietnam,\\xa0Philippines,\\xa0Malaysia, and\\xa0Indonesia.[115]\\xa0Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.[115]\\n\\nAfter the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using\\xa0swift-horse\\xa0cavalry and raising vast armies united by ethnicity and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia\\'s north-western plains, leading eventually to the establishment of the Islamic\\xa0Delhi Sultanate\\xa0in 1206.[116]\\xa0The sultanate was to control much of North India and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs.[117][118]\\xa0By repeatedly repulsing\\xa0Mongol raiders\\xa0in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of\\xa0migration\\xa0of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north.[119][120]\\xa0The sultanate\\'s raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India paved the way for the indigenous\\xa0Vijayanagara Empire.[121]\\xa0Embracing a strong\\xa0Shaivite\\xa0tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India,[122]\\xa0and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.[121]\\n\\nEarly modern India\\n\\nIn the early 16th century, northern India, then under mainly Muslim rulers,[123]\\xa0fell again to the superior mobility and firepower of a new generation of Central Asian warriors.[124]\\xa0The resulting\\xa0Mughal Empire\\xa0did not stamp out the local societies it came to rule. Instead, it balanced and pacified them through new administrative practices[125][126]\\xa0and diverse and inclusive ruling elites,[127]\\xa0leading to more systematic, centralised, and uniform rule.[128]\\xa0Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic identity, especially under\\xa0Akbar, the Mughals united their far-flung realms through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to an emperor who had near-divine status.[127]\\xa0The Mughal state\\'s economic policies, deriving most revenues from agriculture[129]\\xa0and mandating that taxes be paid in the well-regulated silver currency,[130]\\xa0caused peasants and artisans to enter larger markets.[128]\\xa0The relative peace maintained by the empire during much of the 17th century was a factor in India\\'s economic expansion,[128]\\xa0resulting in greater patronage of\\xa0painting, literary forms, textiles, and\\xa0architecture.[131]\\xa0Newly coherent social groups in northern and western India, such as the\\xa0Marathas, the\\xa0Rajputs, and the\\xa0Sikhs, gained military and governing ambitions during Mughal rule, which, through collaboration or adversity, gave them both recognition and military experience.[132]\\xa0Expanding commerce during Mughal rule gave rise to new Indian commercial and political elites along the coasts of southern and eastern India.[132]\\xa0As the empire disintegrated, many among these elites were able to seek and control their own affairs.[133]', metadata={'source': '/tmp/tmp47yal3nh'})]\n",
